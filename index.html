        <h3>Welcome to the Greatest Samurai efficionato Website ever!</h3>
        <h4>Creating the goals around this age and the periods
        </h4>
        <p>Creating the goals around this age and the periods The age where the Samurai fought was called a Japanese Medieval Warfare. The Bushido was also important as it revolved around the Samurai and even towards World War 2. The Sengoku Jidai era began
            the succession of Daimyo's attempted control on the Shogunate and control Japan. Those who attempted this was by the Oda Clan, Nobunaga Oda, the Tokugawa Clan, Ieyasu Tokugawa, and the Toyotomi Clan, Hideyoshi Toyotomi. Famous warriors also
            fought to bring peace and unification to Japan, but many fought for different reason. Those such as Nobunaga Oda, Ieyasu Tokugawa, Hideyoshi Toyotomi, Yukimura Sanada, Nobuyuki Sanada, and more. The Reason for this history is to tell the people
            what Japan has gone through from the beginning 16th century to what we had learned from World War 2, and now. Japan location also influence the ideas of isolation such as the Edo Period under Ieyasu rule after reunify Japan. What the Japanese
            had fought for is unifying Japan, thus many warlord would attempt to achieve peace.. Samuraiâ€™s was mostly warriors trained under the Bushido, with the Yumi Bow and Horseback, but later on, was trained with Naginatas, Muskets, and even Katanas.
            The unification happen twice and Hideyoshi Toyotomi first succeed but his death created tears within the many clans. As a result of those tears was Ieyasu Tokugawa who took his own ambition to reunify Japan. Ieyasu achieved this goal and soon
            he isolated Japan and for 200 years, the European and American would arrived that would soon modernized Japan and led to the Imperialist japanese.
